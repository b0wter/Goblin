# Overview
This is a project I am developing for fun to get some familiarity with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org). It is aimed at people who need a quick way to roll some dice and offer a couple of convenience features (like predifined sets of dice).

You can try it online [here](https://b0wter.github.io/Goblin).
